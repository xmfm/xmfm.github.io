Corrupt binary codes infecting my mind

Perform invocation with numbing freeze

Querying for a variable and seizing the time

To recompile and trigger my destiny

Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid

I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed.

There is no "exception" in this library

For I know I will always go with you

Superhot projectiles pierce the wind

I charged up my armor into lightspeed

Querying for a variable and seizing the time

In a new day coming not so far away

Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid

I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed

There is no "exception" in this library

For I know I will always go with you

Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid

I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed

There is no "exception" in this library

For I know I will always go with you.

Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid,

I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed

There is no "exception" in this library

For I know I will always go with my heart.

Some deserts of this planet were oceans once  
Somewhere shrouded by the night, the sun will shine  
Sometimes I see a dying bird fall to the ground  
But it used to fly so high

I thought I were no more than a bystander  
'Til I felt a touch so real  
I will no longer be a transient  
When I see smiles with tears  
If I have never known the sore of farewell  
And pain of sacrifices  
What else should I engrave on my mind?

Frozen into icy rocks  
That's how it starts (that's how it starts)  
Crumbled like the sands of time  
That's how it ends (that's how it ends)  
Every page of tragedy  
Is thrown away (is thrown away)  
Burned out in the flame

A shoulder for the past  
Let out the cries imprisoned for so long  
A pair of wings for me at this moment  
To soar above this world  
Turn into a shooting star  
That briefly shines but warms up every heart  
May all the beauty be blessed  
May all the beauty be blessed

I will never go  
There's a way back home  
Brighter than tomorrow and yesterday  
May all the beauty be blessed

Wave goodbye to the past when hope and faith  
Have grown so strong and sound  
(Have grown so strong and sound)  
Unfold this pair of wings for me again  
To soar above this world (soar above this world)  
Turned into a moon that always tells the warmth  
And brightness of the sun (and brightness of the sun)  
May all the beauty be blessed  
May all the beauty be blessed
